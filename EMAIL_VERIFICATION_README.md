# Email Verification Flow

## Overview
The email verification system now provides a much better user experience by redirecting users to a beautiful frontend page instead of showing raw JSON.

## How it works

### 1. User Registration
- User registers with email and password
- Backend sends verification email with a link to: `FRONTEND_URL/verify-email?verify_token=TOKEN`

### 2. Email Verification
- User clicks the link in their email
- Frontend loads the `EmailVerificationScreen` component
- Component automatically calls the backend API to verify the token
- Shows loading state while verifying
- Displays success or error message with appropriate styling

### 3. Success Flow
- Shows green checkmark icon
- Displays success message
- Automatically redirects to login page after 5 seconds
- Provides "Go to Login Now" button for immediate redirect

### 4. Error Flow
- Shows red X icon
- Displays error message
- Provides "Go to Login" and "Try Again" buttons
